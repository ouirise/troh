  "body": "10:20 am.. I'm sitting in this office where my world cracked open a year ago. The shuffle of the nurses—it all feels eerily familiar, yet I am carrying a year's worth of battles inside me.\n\nA year ago, I was told the cancer had spread to my liver. Terminal. That word echoed through my bones. And now, here I am, waiting to see if it's still stable.\n\nThat word—**stable**—has become both a prayer and a lifeline.\n\nI've lived through scans, treatments, sleepless nights, and moments of raw hope. I have learned to hold joy and fear in the same breath.\n\nToday isn't just another appointment—it's a reckoning, a reflection, a reminder of how far I have come.\n\nI am not the same person who sat here last year.\n\nI am stronger, wiser, and still standing.\n\nAnd that, in itself, is extraordinary.\n\nWhatever the scan says, this moment is mine.\n\n**It will be great news!!**"
