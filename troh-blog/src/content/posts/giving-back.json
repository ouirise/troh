  "body": "It brings my heart such joy to be able to get out in the battlefield and lend a helping hand.\n\nI love you Mr. Pittman. Thank you for allowing me to chauffeur you to your treatment appointments. I enjoyed our Frisco burgers from Hardees!!!\n\nBeing thrust into this battle has given me the strength I never knew I had.\n\nTayloring Rays of Hope will be a success, and I will be able to transport others to treatment. Missing treatment is not an option in this battle.\n\nFeel free to donate to the payment link on my website. All donations will go to assist others.\n\n**SHINING LIGHT ON ONE LIFE CHANGING DIAGNOSIS AT A TIME..**"
