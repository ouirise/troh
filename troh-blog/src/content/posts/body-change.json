  "body": "Having a double mastectomy is a journey that reshapes you in ways far beyond the physical—it is an act of courage wrapped in grief, hope, fear, and fierce love for life. It means saying goodbye to a part of your body that may have held identity, femininity, or deeply personal memories, while choosing survival even when that choice feels impossibly heavy.\n\nThere is a quiet mourning in the scars, moments of looking in the mirror and learning a new version of yourself, but within those same marks lives undeniable strength.\n\nEach scar becomes proof of endurance, of nights survived, tears shed, and battles fought in silence.\n\nIt is a process of learning that your worth, beauty, and wholeness were never confined to what was taken away.\n\nThrough the pain, vulnerability, and rebuilding, a deeper self emerges—one rooted in resilience, gratitude, and an unshakable will to keep living, loving, and moving forward, even when the path ahead feels uncertain."
